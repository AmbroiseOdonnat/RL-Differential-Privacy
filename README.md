# Differential Privacy in Reinforcement Learning

Report and experiments done to study private RL algorithms for the course of Reinforcement Learning, Master MVA at ENS Paris-Saclay 2022-2023. In this paper, we provide differentially private deep RL algorithms and study the impact of privacy on the learning process.

## Contributions
Our contributions are two folds. (i) We propose central differentially private versions of REINFORCE and DQN algorithms using DP-SGD. (ii) We apply local differentially privacy to theses algorithms. With the increase in privacy, we observe that the learning process is slower and that the convergence is harder to achieve.
